# STEP BY STEP 2D ASTREOIDS GAME ðŸš€ðŸŒ‘
The best way to learn game mechanics is to practice a lot.I think cloning old games is a great way to get started. Now it's time for the astreoids game. And I used the Unity version 2022.3.16f1 to make this game. By the way I mostly used [Zigurous](https://www.youtube.com/@Zigurous)'s [How to make Asteroids in Unity (Complete Tutorial) ðŸš€ðŸŒ‘](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIeWhztKyAg) video to make this game so I thank [Adam Graham](https://github.com/adamgraham) very much :)
